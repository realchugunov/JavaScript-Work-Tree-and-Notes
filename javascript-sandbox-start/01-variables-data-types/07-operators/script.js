// Comparison Operators

/*
x = 2 == 2 //console.log result equal operator comparison would be true.
x = 2 == "2" //console.log result of this equal operator comparison would be also true.

x = 2 === 2 //console.log result of this value comparison would be true.
x = 2 === "2" //console.log result of this value comparison would be false.
              //Triple equality not only evaluates the value but it evaluates the type as well, so types have to be match.

x = 2 != 2; //console.log result of this (not equal = !) comparison would be false. 2 is equal to 2.
x = 2 != "2" //console.log result of this (not equal = !) comparison would be also false.

x = 2 !== "2" //console.log result of this (not equal = !) comparison would be true. because 2 is not equal to "2".
x = 2 !== 2 //console.log result of this (not equal = !) comparison would be false. They're equal.
